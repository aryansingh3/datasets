Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. How many miles did Alisa and Stanley bike in total?
A: Let's think step by step. 
Alisa biked for 4.5 hours. So, she biked for 4 hours and 30 minutes. 
We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes. 
So, 4 hours = 4 × 60 minutes = 240 minutes. 
And 30 minutes = 30 minutes. 
So, 4.5 hours = 240 + 30 minutes = 270 minutes. 
We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes. 
So, 2.5 hours = 2 × 60 minutes = 150 minutes. 

Question 1:
Emma ran at a speed of 9 miles per hour for 3.5 hours. Liam ran at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 2 hours. How many miles did Emma and Liam run in total?
